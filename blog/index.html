      <h2>About My Blog</h2>
      <p>
        I had and still have the dream of become a writer (absolutely, not only writing academic papers). But since the idea came to me, it is only natural to me that I do this when I am somewhat old (and maybe wiser).
      </p>
      <p>
        There's something in my head that would otherwise be too eloquent even to talk with my friends. I am just using them as a practice for becoming a writer. Could be personal, sometimes offensive, but happy to share with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I put two constraints on myself. Every post can only be written within no more than 1 hour. Posts will be in Chinese.
